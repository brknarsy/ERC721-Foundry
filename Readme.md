<h1>ERC721 with Foundry</h1>
In this project I created a sample ERC721 contract and then made some tests with foundry <br>
Later, I deployed it on goerli network using forge

Here's the address of the latest contract -> 0x6A0a2B2562aa7dD3abd55cdD961D13e07E13e513

ATTENTION: In order to deploy this sample project you must create a .env and .secret file in the root and enter your GOERLI_RPC_URL and ETHERSCAN_API_KEY in .env file. You must also enter your seed phrase in .secret file.
